Notes:

We were unsure how long it was supposed to be (we heard varying things), so we've included a shortened and longer version. It was also unclear if a PDF or the template file was supposed to be used. Both are provided (both using the more detailed version of our proposal).
 
We are excited to get started on this soon and look forward to any feedback.
